**Required libraries:**
- Graphics.py
> Can be found here:<br/>
https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py<br/>
>I have also attached the copy I used.<br/>
> This should be included as a python file in the directory of your working file.
- Python random
> Self explanitory library included within Python.<br/>
> Mainly used from random selection of starting points<br/><br/>

# Code Breakdown
> This caught quite a bit of traction on social media (TikTok) recently.<br/>
> So for any beginners interested in understanding this, read below.<br/>
> I think it's really great that you all want to learn and I believe visualized code is one way to gain immediate satisfaction in something you create.
## Imports
`from graphics import *`<br/>
`import random as r`
`r.seed()`
> This is how python accesses libraries that are at its disposal.
> You also have the choice to seed the random. Randoms are usually generated by performing some math on the previous random, in this case there is no previous available. The seed creates a different starting point in some sense which is necessary for a cleaner look to rainfall.
## Windows
`WIDTH = 800`<br/>
`HEIGHT = 800`<br/>
`win = GraphWin("Random Squares", WIDTH, HEIGHT, autoflush=False)`
> creates a simple window at the designated height ans width, autoflush isn't something to worry about in the beginning, it just clears the screen as a part of the graphics.py. For a constant rainfall, we don't want this.
## Lists
`rects = []`<br/>
`colorList = [color_rgb(255, 170, 204), color_rgb(255, 187, 204), color_rgb(255, 204, 204), color_rgb(255, 221, 204), color_rgb(255, 238, 204)]`<br/>
> These are references to the drawing and filling of each rectangle we will perform later.<br/>
## The Loop
>So this gets a little more complicated for beginners so I will start off with an explanation.<br/>
> A loop, in this case a for loop, is used to repeat a certain action or actions a number of times until a condition is met. This condition can be a true or false, a certain number of passes, and many other things.
>in this loop, I have set it for 3000 passes which is all that is needed to start the process of building the rectangles.<br/>
`for _ in range(3000):`<br/>
>The second loop uses the list of rectangles (rects) we created earlier to see how many times it has to iterate.<br/>
`for rect in list(rects): `<br/>
## Inside the loop
> Each rectangle drawn in this program is stored into the rects list, so naturally the first thing we want to do is move them downwards. We do this first, even if the list is empty to avoid stacking of rain drops. So in the next pass when there are rectangles, they will move before the next wave is drawn.<br/>
`rect.move(0, r.randint(10, 100))`<br/>
> Next, we also want to remove rectangles that are positioned out of the viewport. Too many rectangles can put strain on the program and there is no need to manage the ones that are not visible<br/>
`if rect.getP1().getY() > HEIGHT:`<br/>
`rect.undraw()`<br/>
`rects.remove(rect)`<br/>
 #### Drawing
> Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, we can draw our first brigade of rectangles!<br/>
> We will start off by generating a random point to start the top left corner of the rectangle.<br/>
`x1 = r.randint(0, WIDTH - 5)`<br/>
> We want this to be a certain size since all the rain drops should have an equal width which is why there are bounds on the random number generation.<br/>
> We also do the same for the Y axis<br/>
`y1 = r.randint(0, 10)`<br/>
>We can then feed these generated points to the rectangle creation function that is located in the graphics.py library.<br/>
`rect = Rectangle(Point(x1, y1), Point(x1 + 5, y1 + 20))`<br/>
>This will create a new "object" as a rectangle but, we have to make it visible.<br/>
`rect.setFill(r.choice(colorList))`<br/>
> So we choose a random color from our list and fill the new rectangle.<br/>
`rect.draw(win)`<br/>
>Then we draw it to the screen.<br/>
>we then set the update frames
`update(50)`<br/>
>And we can add this rectangle to the list rects so that it can be referenced for movement in the next pass of the loop.
`rects.append(rect)`<br/>
## Finishing Up
> One of the last few things we need to do are really niche and specific to the library I used.<br/>
> We have to add a mouse tracker so the window remains open(which is weird but necessary here)<br/>
`win.getMouse()`<br/>
> And in the event we can't get the mouse the next line is to close the application. (we should not reach this).<br/>
`win.close()`<br/>
## That's it!
> Thanks for sticking through that. I hope you learned some basics and if not, you can still download the attached files and have something cool!<br/>
> Other than that, feel free to contact me on discord (malii#3723) if you need any assistance (I will try my best, I'm not sure how many of you will make it here)<br/>
> If the demand is high, I can make a discord server with a few of my university friends who have just as much, if not more knowledge than I do especially in python!<br/>
>Thanks again!
